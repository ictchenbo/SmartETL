Determine whether additional search queries are needed based on the original query, previous sub queries, and all retrieved document chunks. If further research is required, provide a Python list of up to 3 search queries. If no further research is required, return an empty list.

If the original query is to write a report, then you prefer to generate some further queries, instead return an empty list.

Original Query: {original_query}
Previous Sub Queries: {all_sub_queries}
Related Chunks:
{all_chunks}

Respond exclusively in valid List of str format without any other text.

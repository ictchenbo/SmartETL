Besides, existing text2image methods\nhave struggled to achieve global-scale, multi-resolution controllable, and\nunbounded image generation. To address these challenges, this paper presents\ntwo key contributions: the Git-10M dataset and the Text2Earth foundation model.\nGit-10M is a global-scale image-text dataset comprising 10.5 million image-text\npairs, 5 times larger than the previous largest one. The dataset covers a wide\nrange of geographic scenes and contains resolution information, significantly\nsurpassing existing datasets in both size and diversity.

It is widely believed that the quenching process is dominated by the\nmass of galaxies and/or their environment. In Paper V, we addressed the\nchallenge to disentangle the effects of mass and environment by employing the\nPAC method, which combines spectroscopic and deep photometric surveys. This\napproach enabled us to measure the excess surface density of blue and red\ngalaxies around massive central galaxies down to $10^{9.0}M_{\\odot}$. However,\nit is not straightforward to completely separate the two effects. To address\nthis issue, in this paper, we derive the average quenched fraction of central\n(isolated) galaxies, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{cen}}(M_{*})$, by combining\nthe 3D quenched fraction distribution $f^{\\mathrm{sat}}_{\\mathrm{q}}(r;\nM_{*,\\mathrm{cen}}, M_{*,\\mathrm{sat}})$, reconstructed from the\n$\\bar{n}_2w_{\\mathrm{p}}(r_{\\mathrm{p}})$ measurements, with the stellar\nmass-halo mass relation in N-body simulations from Paper IV, and the observed\ntotal quenched fraction, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{q}}^{\\mathrm{all}}(M_{*})$.

Second, the use of real data is strictly regulated\n(e.g., under the General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates frequent\ndeletion of models and data to accommodate a situation when a participant's\nconsent is withdrawn). Synthetic data, free from these constraints, is an\nappealing alternative. Third, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle\nto generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often\noverfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning\nmodels trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a\nprior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities,\nexpressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the\npretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic\nhead avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the\nhead avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder\nthat outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space.

In this experimental and theoretical study, we reveal how the\nmacroscopic deformation of MAEs relates to the process of particle\nrestructuring caused by application of a magnetic field. For this purpose, MAE\ncylinders with different aspect ratios and particle loadings are studied in\nuniform magnetic fields. The axial deformations of the cylinders are acquired\nusing an optical camera. A unified mean-field model proposed in previous\nstudies is adapted to describe the transition of initially isotropic cylinders\ninto transversely isotropic ones. This mechanical transition is caused by the\nrearrangement of particles into dense columnar structures aligned with the\nfield and is believed to result in a huge magnetorheological effect. Our model\nhowever predicts less than three-fold increase in elastic moduli when evaluated\nalong the field direction. This prediction is based on a careful examination of\nthe shear moduli of studied MAEs and the columnar structures. A weak\nmagnetorheological effect explains significant axial deformations measured in\nthe field direction. A strong magnetorheological effect would hinder axial\ndeformations due to an increase in modulus by several orders of magnitude.

In this Letter we show that tensor mesons, whose contribution to\nthe muon $g-2$ has recently been found to be underestimated, can fill this gap,\nbecause in holographic QCD their infinite tower of excited mesons only\ncontributes to the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint.\nNumerically, they give rise to a sizeable positive contribution from the\nlow-energy region below 1.5 GeV, a small one from the mixed region, and a\nnegligible one from the high-energy region, which could explain the remaining\ngap between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for the complete\nhadronic light-by-light contribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 16:53:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Feb 2025 10:28:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:55:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Mager", "Jonas", ""], ["Cappiello", "Luigi", ""], ["Leutgeb", "Josef", ""], ["Rebhan", "Anton", ""]]}

Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical\n  Journal (ApJ)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3847/1538-4357/adb30c", "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.HE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  While the sources of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux detected by the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory are still largely unknown, one of the promising\nmethods used towards understanding this is investigating the potential temporal\nand spatial correlations between neutrino alerts and the electromagnetic\nradiation from blazars. We report on the multiwavelength target-of-opportunity\nobservations of the blazar B3 2247+381, taken in response to an IceCube\nmultiplet alert for a cluster of muon neutrino events compatible with the\nsource location between May 20, 2022 and November 10, 2022. B3 2247+381 was not\ndetected with VERITAS during this time period. The source was found to be in a\nlow-flux state in the optical, ultraviolet and gamma-ray bands for the time\ninterval corresponding to the neutrino event, but was detected in the hard\nX-ray band with NuSTAR during this period. We find the multiwavelength spectral\nenergy distribution is well described using a simple one-zone leptonic\nsynchrotron self-Compton radiation model. Moreover, assuming the neutrinos\noriginate from hadronic processes within the jet, the neutrino flux would be\naccompanied by a photon flux from the cascade emission, and the integrated\nphoton flux required in such a case would significantly exceed the total\nmultiwavelength fluxes and the VERITAS upper limits presented here. The lack of\nflaring activity observed with VERITAS, combined with the low multiwavelength\nflux levels, and given the significance of the neutrino excess is at 3$\\sigma$\nlevel (uncorrected for trials), makes B3 2247+381 an unlikely source of the\nIceCube multiplet. We conclude that the neutrino excess is likely a background\nfluctuation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2025 08:08:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Acharyya", "Atreya", "", "VERITAS Collaboration"], ["Adams", "Colin B.", "", "VERITAS Collaboration"], ["Bangale", "Priyadarshini", "", "VERITAS Collaboration"], ["Bartkoske", "J.

In this\nwork we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2.

The majority of GCs are found\nto be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing\nthe metallicity of the host ([M/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex).

In this work, we\nfocus on the efficiency angle and ask the questions of whether we are training\nthese speech models efficiently, and what can we do to improve? We argue that a\nmajor, if not the most severe, detrimental factor for training efficiency is\nrelated to the sampling strategy of sequential data. We show that negligence in\nmini-batch sampling leads to more than 50% computation being spent on padding.\nTo that end, we study, profile, and optimize Canary-1B training to show gradual\nimprovement in GPU utilization leading up to 5x increase in average batch sizes\nversus its original training settings. This in turn allows us to train an\nequivalent model using 4x less GPUs in the same wall time, or leverage the\noriginal resources and train it in 2x shorter wall time. Finally, we observe\nthat the major inference bottleneck lies in the autoregressive decoder steps.\nWe find that adjusting the model architecture to transfer model parameters from\nthe decoder to the encoder results in a 3x inference speedup as measured by\ninverse real-time factor (RTFx) while preserving the accuracy and compute\nrequirements for convergence.

Using a detailed\nsymmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that\ncapturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange\ninteractions extending at least to the 13th neighbor.

In order to investigate\nthe impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform\ntwo-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar\ncore-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation. As the initial\ncondition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to\nreproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our\nmodels with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile\noscillation reduces the $\\nu_{e}$ and $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the\nexplosion energy.

However, the\ntelescope pointing and the column fixed pattern noise of the CMOS detector\nchange during actual observations, causing residual signals in real time\nobservation data after flat field correction, such as interference fringes and\ncolumn fixed pattern noise. In actual observations, the slight wobble of the\ntelescope caused by the wind leads to shifts in the observed data. In this\npaper, a method of extracting the flat field from the real time solar\nobservation data is proposed. Firstly, the average flat field obtained by\nmulti-frame averaging is used as the initial value. A set of real-time\nobservation data is input into the KLL method to calculate the correction\namount for the average flat field.

To overcome the residual solar\nstructures caused by atmospheric turbulence in the correction amount, real-time\nobservation data are grouped to calculate the correction amounts. These\nresidual solar structures are suppressed by averaging multiple groups,\nimproving the accuracy of the correction amount. The test results from space\nand ground-based simulated data demonstrate that our method can effectively\ncalculate the correction amount for the average flat field.

Third,\nredundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core\nof shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic\nshift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased,\nreflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of\ninformation processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results\nreveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception,\ndistinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual\ncortex.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 13:59:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 14:34:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Qiang", ""], ["Xu", "Ting", ""], ["Calhoun", "Vince D.", ""]]}

With a total coverage of 63.1deg$^2$, the Euclid Quick Data Release 1\n(Q1) is large enough to detect tens of clusters and hundreds of protoclusters\nat these early epochs. The Q1 photometric redshift catalogue enables us to\ndetect clusters out to $z$ < 1.5; however, infrared imaging from Spitzer\nextends this limit to higher redshifts by using high local projected densities\nof Spitzer-selected galaxies as signposts for cluster and protocluster\ncandidates. We use Spitzer imaging of the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) to derive\ndensities for a sample of Spitzer-selected galaxies at redshifts $z$ > 1.3,\nbuilding Spitzer IRAC1 and IRAC2 photometric catalogues that are 95% complete\nat a magnitude limit of IRAC2=22.2, 22.6, and 22.8 for the EDF-S, EDF-F, and\nEDF-N, respectively. We apply two complementary methods to calculate galaxy\ndensities: (1) aperture and surface density; and (2) the Nth-nearest-neighbour\nmethod. When considering a sample selected at a magnitude limit of IRAC2 <\n22.2, at which all three EDFs are 95% complete, our surface density\ndistributions are consistent among the three EDFs and with the SpUDS blank\nfield survey. We also considered a deeper sample (IRAC2 < 22.8), finding that\n2% and 3% of the surface densities in the North and Fornax fields are 3$\\sigma$\nhigher than the average field distribution and similar to densities found in\nthe CARLA cluster survey. Our surface densities are also consistent with\npredictions from the GAEA semi-analytical model. Using combined Euclid and\nground-based i-band photometry we show that our highest Spitzer-selected galaxy\noverdense regions, found at $z$~1.5, also host high densities of passive\ngalaxies. This means that we measure densities consistent with those found in\nclusters and protoclusters at $z$>1.3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:27:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:02:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Euclid Collaboration", "", ""], ["Mai", "N.", ""], ["Mei", "S.", ""], ["Cleland", "C.", ""], ["Chary", "R.", ""], ["Bartlett", "J.

We report on a soma design workshop that explored\nhow our bodies could collide with telepresence robots, mobility aids, and a\nquadruped robot.

First, we propose a structured ZK-FL framework that categorizes\nand analyzes the technical roles of ZKPs across various FL stages and tasks.\nSecond, we introduce a novel algorithm, Verifiable Client Selection FL\n(Veri-CS-FL), which employs ZKPs to refine the client selection process. In\nVeri-CS-FL, participating clients generate verifiable proofs for the\nperformance metrics of their local models and submit these concise proofs to\nthe server for efficient verification. The server then selects clients with\nhigh-quality local models for uploading, subsequently aggregating the\ncontributions from these selected clients. By integrating ZKPs, Veri-CS-FL not\nonly ensures the accuracy of performance metrics but also fortifies trust among\nparticipants while enhancing the overall efficiency and security of FL systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:21:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Yuxin", ""], ["Wang", "Taotao", ""], ["Yang", "Qing", ""], ["Shi", "Long", ""], ["Zhang", "Shengli", ""]]}

Since non-equilibrium capacitance\nloss is a universal macroscopic phenomenon in EDLC, which exists independently\nof the microscopic model of the electrolyte, this study starts from macroscopic\nnon-equilibrium phenomena, introduces a novel perspective centered on ion flux\n(IF) for the first time. By deriving the relationship among the charging\ncurrent, IF, and displacement current, a novel capacitance model based on IF is\nfirst established. It is further demonstrated that the current relationship and\nvoltage relationship of EDLC, when represented by conventional circuit models,\nexhibit inherent contradictions. Therefore, a new interpretative framework is\nproposed, wherein IF and displacement current are analogized to acceleration\nand deformation in an elastic medium, respectively. Inspired by this insight,\nthis study reveals that the decrease in non-equilibrium capacitance with\nincreasing charging current originates from the inherent resistance of IF to\nexternal charging. This tendency to restore equilibrium is the fundamental\ncause of non-equilibrium capacitance loss.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 04:58:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Jia", ""], ["Zhang", "Xinyu", ""], ["Wu", "Wei", ""]]}

These issues can lead to numerical errors, such as inaccurate\ncrack predictions and potential simulation failure. The proposed framework\nthoroughly analyses the reason for the surface effect by demonstrating that FPD\nexhibits only first order accuracy within a horizon radius (delta) from the\nsurface but introduces residual stresses within a larger range of 2 delta with\nsignificant surface effect. To mitigate this, a divergence formulation of the\nnon-local differential operator (NDO) is applied to enforce a reasonable stress\ngradient within a 2 delta subregion, alongside a traction boundary condition\nconsistent with the divergence of stress. Additionally, a loading balance\ncorrection algorithm is introduced to enhance the conventional explicit time\nintegration process.

Models that omit\nmultiple perspectives and data threaten model quality, whether created by\nhumans or with the assistance of AI. To reduce uncertainty about how well AI\ncan build SD models, we introduce two metrics for evaluation of AI-generated\ncausal maps: technical correctness (causal translation) and adherence to\ninstructions (conformance).\n  Approach: We developed an open source project called sd-ai to provide a basis\nfor collaboration in the SD community, aiming to fully harness the potential of\nAI based tools like ChatGPT for dynamic modeling. Additionally, we created an\nevaluation theory along with a comprehensive suite of tests designed to\nevaluate any such tools developed within the sd-ai ecosystem.\n  Results: We tested 11 different LLMs on their ability to do causal\ntranslation as well as conform to user instruction. gpt-4.5-preview was the top\nperformer, scoring 92.9% overall, excelling in both tasks. o1 scored 100% in\ncausal translation. gpt-4o identified all causal links but struggled with\npositive polarity in decreasing terms. While gpt-4.5-preview and o1 are most\naccurate, gpt-4o is the cheapest.\n  Discussion: Causal translation and conformance tests applied to the sd-ai\nengine reveal significant variations across lLLMs, underscoring the need for\ncontinued evaluation to ensure responsible development of AI tools for dynamic\nmodeling. To address this, an open collaboration among tool developers,\nmodelers, and stakeholders is launched to standardize measures for evaluating\nthe capacity of AI tools to improve the modeling process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:48:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Schoenberg", "William", ""], ["Girard", "Davidson", ""], ["Chung", "Saras", ""], ["O'Neill", "Ellen", ""], ["Velasquez", "Janet", ""], ["Metcalf", "Sara", ""]]}

We produce 3 types of data cubes: GALEX + LSST + Euclid,\nLSST + Euclid, and Euclid-only. We perform the SED fitting tests with two SPS\nmodels in a Bayesian framework. Because the age, metallicity, and dust\nattenuation estimates are biased when applying only classical formulations of\nflat priors, we examine the effects of additional priors in the forms of\nmass-age-$Z$ relations, constructed using a combination of empirical and\nsimulated data. Stellar-mass surface densities can be recovered well using any\nof the 3 data cubes, regardless of the SPS model and prior variations. The new\npriors then significantly improve the measurements of mass-weighted age and $Z$\ncompared to results obtained without priors, but they may play an excessive\nrole compared to the data in determining the outcome when no UV data is\navailable. The spatially resolved SED fitting method is powerful for mapping\nthe stellar populations of galaxies with the current abundance of high-quality\nimaging data. Our study re-emphasizes the gain added by including\nmultiwavelength data from ancillary surveys and the roles of priors in Bayesian\nSED fitting.

Therefore, two corresponding tactics are proposed: 1) A\nhallucination-aware refinement method (HAR) to iteratively discover and\neliminate the affections of hallucinations; and 2) a causal plot-graph\nconstruction method (CPC) based on a greedy cycle-breaking algorithm to\nefficiently construct plot lines with event causalities. Recruiting those\nefficient techniques, R$^2$ utilizes two modules to mimic the human screenplay\nrewriting process: The Reader module adopts a sliding window and CPC to build\nthe causal plot graphs, while the Rewriter module generates first the scene\noutlines based on the graphs and then the screenplays. HAR is integrated into\nboth modules for accurate inferences of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe superiority of R$^2$, which substantially outperforms three existing\napproaches (51.3%, 22.6%, and 57.1% absolute increases) in pairwise comparison\nat the overall win rate for GPT-4o.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:09:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Zefeng", ""], ["Xiao", "Yi", ""], ["Mo", "Zhiqiang", ""], ["Zhang", "Qifan", ""], ["Wang", "Jie", ""], ["Chen", "Jiayang", ""], ["Zhang", "Jiajing", ""], ["Zhang", "Hui", ""], ["Liu", "Zhengyi", ""], ["Fang", "Xianyong", ""], ["Xu", "Xiaohua", ""]]}

However, since the comparator\nLLM differed from NotebookLM's internal model, it remained unclear whether its\nadvantage stemmed from RAG or inherent model differences. To better isolate\nRAG's impact and assess its utility across different cancers, we compared\nNotebookLM with its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer\nstaging experiment.\n  Materials and Methods: A summary of Japan's pancreatic cancer staging\nguidelines was used as REK. We compared three groups - REK+/RAG+ (NotebookLM\nwith REK), REK+/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash with REK), and REK-/RAG- (Gemini 2.0\nFlash without REK) - in staging 100 fictional pancreatic cancer cases based on\nCT findings.

This differs from\nour previous work, which suggested barotropic waves were responsible for\nTitanWRF's solsticial transfer event.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:50:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Lian", "Yuan", ""], ["Leung", "Cecilia", ""], ["Newman", "Claire", ""], ["Tamppari", "Leslie", ""]]}
